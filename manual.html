      <h1>Manual</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name's Mike, and I'm the game creator of Miles and Kilo. I'm here to teach you some tips and tricks that should help you beat the game.</p>
      
      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>If you've died 50 times on the first level, don't worry! You're not alone, and you can and will get better with practice. Miles &amp; Kilo is an unusually difficult game, especially by App Store standards. By design, there are no in-game tutorials of any kind. You can learn how to play the game in a "trial by fire" if you want to, but that's not for everyone's cup of tea, which is why I'm writing this guide. I'm not going to tell you how to beat each level, but I <i>am</i> going to give you some pointers that will help you get to the end.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Jumping</h2>
<p>To jump, simply tap on the left side of the screen. If you've already played the game a little, you've probably noticed that the jumping feels very "heavy." This is by design! As soon as you release your thumb from the left side of the screen, Miles (or Kilo) will start to drop practically instantly. This is super useful for making high precision jumps.</p>

<p>Based on my observations, most players will initially be tempted to think of jumping in binary terms. That is, they'll probably either want to do a quick tap to perform a short jump, or hold their left thumb down for the entirety of the jump to do a long one. While this works on the first level, it won't on the second! At the beginning of World 1-2, there's a series of three gaps, all with the same width. A short hop won't allow you to cross the first one, while a long jump will make you overshoot it and fall to your death into the following gap. To clear this section, you'll need to wait to release your left thumb as soon as you clear each gap.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Bouncing off of baddies</h2>

<p>You can jump on most of the baddies in this game! After landing on their heads, you'll bounce off them. Like a normal jump, however, you can control the height of the bounce. Leave your left thumb off the screen to do a short bounce, or hold your left thumb down to bounce longer. And, of course, release your thumb at any time to immediately stop dropping. This is an important mechanic in later levels, as some gaps can only be cleared by controlling your bounce off of carefully placed baddies.</p>

<p>Here's another way of thinking of it: You can use baddies as short-lived platforms, so if you need to gain some extra height, "jump" when you land on a baddie.</p>
