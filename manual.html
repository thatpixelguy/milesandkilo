      <h1>Manual</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name's Mike, and I'm the game creator of Miles and Kilo. I'm here to teach you some tips and tricks to help you get better at the game!</p>
      
      <p>If you've died 50 times on the first level, don't worry! You're not alone, and you can and will get better with practice. Miles &amp; Kilo is an unusually difficult game, especially by App Store standards. By design, there are no in-game tutorials of any kind. You can learn how to play the game in a "trial by fire" if you want to, but that's not for everyone's cup of tea, which is why I'm writing this guide. I'm not going to tell you how to beat each level, but I <i>am</i> going to give you some pointers that will help you get to the end.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Jumping</h2>
<p>If you've died 50 times on the first level, don't worry! You're not alone, and you can and will get better with practice. Miles &amp; Kilo is an unusually difficult game, especially by App Store standards. By design, there are no in-game tutorials of any kind. You can learn how to play the game in a "trial by fire" if you want to, but that's not for everyone's cup of tea, which is why I'm writing this guide. I'm not going to tell you how to beat each level, but I <i>am</i> going to give you some pointers that will help you get to the end.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Jumping</h2>
<p>To jump, simply tap on the left side of the screen. If you've already played the game a little, you've probably noticed that the jumping feels very "heavy." This is by design! As soon as you release your thumb from the left side of the screen, Miles (or Kilo) will start to drop practically instantly. This is super useful for making high precision jumps.</p>

<p>Based on my observations, most players will initially be tempted to think of jumping in binary terms. That is, they'll probably either want to do a quick tap to perform a short jump, or hold their left thumb down for the entirety of the jump to do a long one. While this works on the first level, it won't on the second!</p>

<p>At the beginning of World 1-2, there's a series of three gaps, all with the same width. A short hop won't allow you to cross the first gap, while a long jump will make you overshoot it and fall to your death into the following gap. To clear this section, you'll need to wait to release your left thumb as soon as you clear each gap.</p>

<p>Once you've mastered jumping, I think you'll find the rest of the game much easier to deal with.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Bouncing off baddies</h2>

<p>You can safely jump onto most of the baddies in this game. Immediately after landing on their heads, you'll automatically bounce off them.</p>

<p>Baddie bouncing behaves exactly like jumping: Keep your left thumb <b>off</b> the screen to do a short bounce, or hold your left thumb down to do a long bounce. And, of course, release your thumb at any time to immediately stop dropping. This is an important mechanic in later levels, as some gaps can only be cleared by controlling your bounce off of carefully placed baddies.</p>

<p>Here's another way of thinking of it: You can use baddies as short-lived platforms, so if you need to gain some extra height, "jump" when you land on a baddie.</p>

<h2>Tip #3: Throwing fruit</h2>

<p>If you've played the game, you've probably already discovered that tapping on the right side of the screen will make Miles throw fruit. Fruit knocks out baddies (very useful!), but you also have a limited amount of ammo in your possession. You can hold up to five pieces of fruit at a time (indicated by the meter on the topright of the screen), but you can refill it by picking up fruit placed throughout most levels. Your fruit refills at the beginning of each level, but be careful not to throw it all away too quickly.</p>

<p>Also, pick your targets wisely. In the previous section I pointed out that you can bounce off baddies and use them as platforms. However, if you knockout a baddie with fruit, it can no longer serve as a platform! Many of the later levels are designed to use baddies to help you cross gaps, so KO'ing those baddies with fruit will always lead to your death. Remember: Just because you <i>can</i> KO a baddie doesn't mean you <i>should</i>.

<h2>Tip #4: Sliding, punching, and more!</h2>

<p>Miles &amp; Kilo allows you to perform a wide variety of actions using a relatively simple scheme: Tapping on the left always makes you jump, but tapping on the right will cause your character to perform certain actions depending on where he is and what he's doing.</p>

<p>For example, if Miles is close to a tunnel, a right-tap will make him slide through it. If he's close to a wall of breakable blocks, he'll punch through them. And if there aren't any special cases, then he'll just throw some fruit.</p>

<p>Similarly, Kilo has two moves he can perform: A homing dash attack and a somersault. If he's running on the ground, tapping with your right thumb causes him to sommersault. This is similar to Miles's slide move, with two key differences: Kilo can sommersault whenever he wants to while grounded, and he'll KO any enemies he hits while sommersaulting.</p>

<p>To use his homing attack, Kilo needs to jump into the air first. If a baddie is within range, it'll be covered by a red target reticle. Once you see this appear, you can tap with your right thumb to use your homing attack. After Kilo lands on the baddie, he'll bounce off it in the same way that Miles bounces off baddies.</p>
