# Manual

Hi! I'm Mike Burns, the creator of *Miles & Kilo*. Thanks for checking out my game! If you've played it a little already, you've probably discovered that it's pretty tough. This online manual will give you some pointers to help you improve and eventually beat the game.

*Note: This manual is currently a work in progress. After I finish writing it up, I'll add a few short videos to demonstrate a variety of techniques you can use in the game.*

## Part 1: Mastering the Jump

### Basic jumping

Simply tap on the left side of the screen to perform a jump. A quick tap will let you cross short gaps, hop over low obstacles, and jump onto the heads of baddies.

Hold your left thumb down to perform a longer, higher jump. This will allow you to cover much longer distances and clear higher walls.

**Pro-tip:** As soon as you release your thumb while airborne, you start to drop. This allows you to make more accurate jumps that are kind of in-between a short hop and a long leap. This is a super important mechanic in the game's later levels.

### Bouncing off baddies

If you land on the head of a baddie, you'll bounce off them. This allows you to use baddies as platforms to cross super wide gaps.

Bouncing off a baddie works the same as a jump. If you leave your left thumb off the screen after you land on a baddie, then the bounce will be short. If you hold your left thumb down, however, then your bounce will be higher and longer. Knowing when to do a short bounce or a long bounce is often the key to passing tricky levels.

**Pro-tip:** You can combo jumping and bouncing in a variety of different ways. For instance, you can do a long jump onto a baddie, then do a long bounce off; or do a short jump onto a baddie, then a long bounce off.
