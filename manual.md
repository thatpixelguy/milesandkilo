Thanks for checking out Miles & Kilo! In order to keep the experience as authentically old school as possible, the game contains no built-in tutorials. If you want to jump right in and figure things out on your own, go for it!

For everyone else, I decided to make this online manual to explain the game's controls and demonstrate a few important techniques. This isn't an exhaustive list of everything you can do in the game, but it covers the basics with some cool videos.

If you'd like more tips, please feel free to <a href="mailto:mike@thepixelguy.com">send me an email</a>; I'd be happy to help!
