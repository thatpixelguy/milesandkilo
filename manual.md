Thanks for checking out Miles & Kilo! In order to keep the experience as authentically old school as possible, the game contains no in-game tutorials. If you want to jump right in and figure things out on your own, go for it!

However, it *is* the 21st century, so I decided to make this online manual to go over the game's controls and demonstrates a few important techniques. This isn't an exhaustive list of everything you can do in the game, but it covers the basics. If you'd like more tips, please feel free to <a href="mailto:mike@thepixelguy.com">send me an email</a>. I'd be happy to help!
