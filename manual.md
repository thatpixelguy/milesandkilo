# Manual

Hi! I'm Mike Burns, the creator of *Miles & Kilo*. Thanks for checking out my game! If you've played it a little already, you've probably discovered that it's pretty tough. This online manual will give you some pointers to help you improve and eventually beat the game.

*Note: This manual is currently a work in progress. After I finish writing it up, I'll add a few short videos to demonstrate a variety of techniques you can use in the game.*

## Part 1: Mastering the Jump

### Basic jumping

Simply tap on the left side of the screen to perform a jump. A quick tap will let you cross short gaps, hop over low obstacles, and jump onto the heads of baddies.

(Short jump GIF goes here.)

Hold your left thumb down to perform a longer, higher jump. This will allow you to cover much longer distances and clear higher walls.

(Long jump GIF goes here.)

**Pro Tip:** As soon as you release your thumb while airborne, you start to drop. This allows you to make more accurate jumps that are kind of in-between a short hop and a long leap. The idea behind this mechanic is to allow you to fall as soon as *you* want to fall, rather than require you to estimate how far you want to jump in advance.

### Bouncing off baddies

If you land on the head of a baddie, you'll bounce off them. This allows you to use baddies as platforms to cross super wide gaps.

(Short bounce GIF goes here.)

Bouncing off a baddie works the same as a jump. If you leave your left thumb off the screen after you land on a baddie, then the bounce will be short. If you hold your left thumb down, however, then your bounce will be higher and longer. Knowing when to do a short bounce or a long bounce is often the key to passing tricky levels.

(Long bounce GIF goes here.)

**Pro Tip:** You can combo jumping and bouncing in a variety of different ways. For instance, you can do a long jump onto a baddie, then do a long bounce off; or do a short jump onto a baddie, then a long bounce off; etc. 

## Part 2: Actions

Actions are performed by simply tapping the right side of the screen. Miles and Kilo each have a different set of actions, so the action you perform depends on which character you're playing as and what that character is currently doing.

### Miles's actions

By default, tapping with your right thumb will make Miles throw fruit. 

(Fruit throwing GIF goes here.)

If he's standing in front of a tunnel, a right-tap will make him slide under the tunnel.

(Sliding GIF goes here.)

If he's standing in front of a bunch of suspiciously weak-looking blocks, he'll punch through them.

(Punching GIF goes here.)

### Kilo's actions

When Kilo is running on the ground, a right-tap will make him somersault. Somersaulting allows Kilo to roll under small tunnels and smash through breakable blocks.

When Kilo is jumping, a right-tap will make him perform a homing attack on the nearest baddie (if the baddie is within range.) After hitting the baddie, Kilo will bounce in the air -- remember, you can use this to clear long gaps!
