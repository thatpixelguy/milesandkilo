# Manual

*Note: This manual is currently a work in progress. After I finish writing it up, I'll add a few short videos to demonstrate a variety of techniques you can use in the game.*

## Part 1: Jumping

### Short jumps

Simply tap on the left side of the screen to perform a jump. A quick tap will let you cross short gaps, hop over low obstacles, and jump onto the heads of baddies.

### Long jumps

Hold your left thumb down to perform a longer, higher jump. This will allow you to cover much longer distances and clear higher walls.

**Pro Tip:** As soon as you release your thumb while airborne, you start to drop. This allows you to make more accurate jumps that are kind of in-between a short hop and a long leap. The idea behind this mechanic is to allow you to fall as soon as *you* want to fall, rather than require you to estimate how far you want to jump in advance.

## Part 2: Bouncing off baddies

### Short bounces

If you land on the head of a baddie, you'll bounce off them. This allows you to use baddies as platforms to cross super wide gaps.

### Long bounces

Bouncing off a baddie works the same as a jump. If you leave your left thumb off the screen after you land on a baddie, then the bounce will be short. If you hold your left thumb down, however, then your bounce will be higher and longer. Knowing when to do a short bounce or a long bounce is often the key to passing tricky levels.

**Pro Tip:** You can combo jumping and bouncing in a variety of different ways. For instance, you can do a long jump onto a baddie, then do a long bounce off; or do a short jump onto a baddie, then a long bounce off; etc. 

## Part 3: Actions

Actions are performed by simply tapping the right side of the screen. Miles and Kilo each have a different set of actions, so the action you perform depends on which character you're playing as and what that character is currently doing.

### Miles's actions

By default, tapping with your right thumb will make Miles throw fruit. 

(Fruit throwing GIF goes here.)

If he's standing in front of a tunnel, a right-tap will make him slide under the tunnel.

If he's standing in front of a bunch of suspiciously weak-looking blocks, he'll punch through them.

### Kilo's actions

When Kilo is running on the ground, a right-tap will make him somersault. Somersaulting allows Kilo to roll under small tunnels and smash through breakable blocks.

When Kilo is jumping, a right-tap will make him perform a homing attack on the nearest baddie (if the baddie is within range.) After hitting the baddie, Kilo will bounce in the air -- remember, you can use this to clear long gaps!
