# Manual

Hi! I'm Mike Burns, the creator of *Miles & Kilo*. Thanks for checking out my game! If you've played it already, you've probably discovered that it's pretty tough. This online manual will give you some pointers to help you improve and eventually beat the game.

*Note: This manual is currently a work in progress. After I finish writing it up, I'll add a few short videos to demonstrate a variety of techniques you can use in the game.*

# Part 1: Mastering the Jump

Simply tap on the left side of the screen to perform a jump. A quick tap will let you cross short gaps, hop over low obstacles, and jump onto the heads of baddies.

Hold your left thumb down to perform a longer, higher jump. This will allow you to cover much longer distances and clear higher walls.

Also, note that as soon as you release your thumb, you start to drop. This allows you to make more accurate jumps that are in between a short hop and a long leap. It's very important to master this mechanic if you want to clear the later levels.
