## Part 4: Kilo's actions

### Somersaulting

When Kilo is running on the ground, a right-tap will make him somersault. Somersaulting allows Kilo to roll under small tunnels and smash through breakable blocks.

### Homing attacks

When Kilo is jumping, a right-tap will make him perform a homing attack on the nearest baddie (if the baddie is within range.) After hitting the baddie, Kilo will bounce in the air -- remember, you can use this to clear long gaps!

**Pro Tip:** It's *usually* a good idea to keep your left thumb held down while chaining homing attacks on a series of baddies. This helps ensure you don't quickly fall to your death.

In general, a good rule of thumb for jumping is to only release your left thumb when you're ready to fall.
