## Part 4: Kilo's actions

When Kilo is running on the ground, a right-tap will make him somersault. Somersaulting allows Kilo to roll under small tunnels and smash through breakable blocks.

When Kilo is jumping, a right-tap will make him perform a homing attack on the nearest baddie (if the baddie is within range.) After hitting the baddie, Kilo will bounce in the air -- remember, you can use this to clear long gaps!
