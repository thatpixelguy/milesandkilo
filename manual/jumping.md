## Part 1: Jumping

### Short jumps

Simply tap on the left side of the screen to perform a jump. A quick tap will let you cross short gaps, hop over low obstacles, and jump onto the heads of baddies.

### Long jumps

Hold your left thumb down to perform a longer, higher jump. This will allow you to cover much longer distances and clear higher walls.

**Pro Tip:** As soon as you release your thumb while airborne, you start to drop. This allows you to make more accurate jumps that are kind of in-between a short hop and a long leap. The idea behind this mechanic is to allow you to fall as soon as *you* want to fall, rather than require you to estimate how far you want to jump in advance.
