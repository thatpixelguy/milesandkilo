## Part 1: Jumping

### Short jumps

Simply tap on the left side of the screen to perform a jump. A quick tap will let you cross short gaps, hop over low obstacles, and jump onto the heads of baddies.

### Long jumps

Hold your left thumb down to perform a longer, higher jump. This will allow you to cover much longer distances and clear higher walls.

### Mid jumps

As soon as you release your left thumb while jumping, you start to drop quickly. This allows you to make more accurate jumps that are kind of in-between a short hop and a long jump.
