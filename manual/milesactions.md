## Part 3: Miles's Actions

In general, actions are performed by simply tapping the right side of the screen. Miles and Kilo each have a different set of actions, so the action you perform depends on which character you're playing as and what that character is currently doing.

### Throwing fruit

By default, tapping with your right thumb will make Miles throw fruit.

### Sliding

If Miles is in front of a tunnel, a right-tap will make him slide under the tunnel.

### Punching

If Miles is in front of a bunch of suspiciously weak-looking blocks, he'll punch through them.
