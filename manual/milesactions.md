## Part 3: Miles's Actions

In general, actions are performed by simply tapping the right side of the screen. Miles and Kilo each have a different set of actions, so the action you perform depends on which character you're playing as and what that character is currently doing.

### Miles's actions

By default, tapping with your right thumb will make Miles throw fruit. 

(Fruit throwing GIF goes here.)

If he's standing in front of a tunnel, a right-tap will make him slide under the tunnel.

If he's standing in front of a bunch of suspiciously weak-looking blocks, he'll punch through them.
