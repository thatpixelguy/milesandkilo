## Part 5: Scoring

In each level, you can earn one of five ranks: S, A, B, C, or D. Here's the following grading criteria:

1. Beat the level's target time.
2. Collected every coin in the level.
3. Finished the level with five pieces of fruit.
4. Beat the level on your first attempt in the current playthrough.

If you accomplish all four of these, you'll get an S. If you miss one then you'll get an A, if you miss two then you'll get a B, and so on.

In Story Mode, you'll receive a score bonus for the rank you earned:

| Rank   | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| S      | 4000  |
| A      | 3000  |
| B      | 2000  |
| C      | 1000  |
| D      | 0     |

S-Ranks are intended to be super difficult to get, and they can only be earned in Story Mode. In Practice Mode you can earn up to an A-Rank. (#4 on the grading criteria is discounted in Practice Mode.)
