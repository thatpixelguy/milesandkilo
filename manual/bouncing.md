## Part 2: Bouncing off baddies

### Short bounces

If you land on the head of a baddie, you'll bounce off them. This allows you to use baddies as platforms to cross super wide gaps.

### Long bounces

Bouncing off a baddie works the same as a jump. If you leave your left thumb off the screen after you land on a baddie, then the bounce will be short. If you hold your left thumb down, however, then your bounce will be higher and longer. Knowing when to do a short bounce or a long bounce is often the key to passing tricky levels.

**Pro Tip:** You can combo jumping and bouncing in a variety of different ways. For instance, you can do a long jump onto a baddie, then do a long bounce off; or do a short jump onto a baddie, then a long bounce off; etc.
