## Part 2: Bouncing off baddies

### Short bounces

If you land on the head of a baddie, you'll bounce off them. This allows you to use baddies as platforms to cross super wide gaps.

### Long bounces

Hold your thumb down after landing on a baddie to bounce higher and farther. (Note: This also works when bouncing off springs and ballons!)

You can combo jumping and bouncing in a variety of different ways. For instance, you can do a short jump onto a baddie, then do a long bounce off.
